  <p>Dear House Coordinators:<br>
  We would ask that you please complete the following form every two periods.</p>

  <p>Please consider the following:
    <ol>
      <li>Please complete this as a total review of the last two attendance periods.</li>
      <li>While it is not necessary for this to be complete by you jointly, we would ask that you set aside some time of prayer together before completing this form.</li>
      <li>Only one HC should submit this form. One HC survey form per house.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>


  <p>Here are some questions to consider in giving an overall assessment of your house and the trainees. Please note: not every question must be answered. These are simply meant as a guide in your overall assessment.
    <ol>
      <li>Participation in house times</li>
      <li>Overall exercise of the spirit</li>
      <li>Overall openness to the house</li>
      <li>Interaction with others (team, service, etc.)</li>
      <li>Attitude of help, fellowship, etc.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    Much grace to you!<br>
    FTTA Office
