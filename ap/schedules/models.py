- WeeklyEvents:
- Schedule:
    a collection of events for one trainee. each trainee should have one

'''
Schedules stack on top of each other to create a master schedule for each trainee
Base schedules may include rising schedule, meal schedule, class schedule, night schedule
Special schedules may include a specific campus's work schedule (UCLA, USC, OCC, PCC), ITERO, service week, Thanksgiving
(e.g. Campus - CHAP - Chapman University - Orange, Class - General Class, Conference - Memorial Day Meals)
A complete schedule would result from something like 
Rise + meal + class + UCLA work + UCLA study + night = schedule for UCLA trainee for a normal week
Schedules can not be edited, only cloned + deactivated.
All active schedules carry over from term to term -> 4th termres taken off, 
1st termers addee
Deactivation governed by length of trainees attached to schedule
It is done by taking trainees off schedules, this prevents human 
error of accidentally reactivating a schedule with a stale set of 
trainees attached to it
